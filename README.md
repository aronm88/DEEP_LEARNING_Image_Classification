# DEEP_LEARNING_Image_Classification
Streamlit web application that utilizes the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification


In this project, a precise Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed from scratch, without relying on any pre-trained models. The model comprises convolutional layers that process images and flatten them before further processing them with dense layers. The Soft Max function is used to determine the probability of the image belonging to a specific category, and the image is assigned accordingly. The Accuracy is the primary evaluation metric used to evaluate the performance of this model. Overall, this project showcases the impressive capabilities of CNNs in accurately classifying images. <br><br>
